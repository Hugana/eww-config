This is the eww config for a systemtray bar in arch linux, hope you enjoy :)

![Preview do Eww](bar.png)

This image also shows the use of waybar for systemtray management.

The functionalities of this bar are from left to right, starting with 3 buttons, one to close, followed by suspend and log out. Then there are the 10 workspace buttons with active indicator and PC brightness. To the right is the button for switching power management modes, followed by ram, volume and date. Some of the buttons show information when hovered over.

Also the location of the eww bar is more above in the y axis because this setup is meant to use with waybar.
